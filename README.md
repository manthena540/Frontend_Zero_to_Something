## 📅 React Learning Plan

### 🚀 Introduction to React
- **What is React?**: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, especially for single-page applications (SPAs).
- **React Components**: Learn the basic building blocks of React — components.
- **Why React?**: Understand why React is so popular and its advantages, such as virtual DOM, reusable components, and unidirectional data flow.

### 🧑‍💻 Day 1-7: Fundamentals of React
- **Day 1**: Set up React environment using `create-react-app` or custom Webpack setup.
- **Day 2**: Learn about **JSX** — the syntax extension for JavaScript that looks like HTML.
- **Day 3**: Understand **React Components**: functional vs class components.
- **Day 4**: Learn about **Props** (short for properties) to pass data between components.
- **Day 5**: **State**: Learn how to create and manage state within components.
- **Day 6**: Understanding **Event Handling** in React — binding events and using them inside components.
- **Day 7**: Practice by building a simple **React app** with components and state.

### 🌱 Day 8-14: Deepening Knowledge
- **Day 8**: Learn about **useEffect** Hook to perform side effects in functional components.
- **Day 9**: **useState** Hook: Work with state in functional components.
- **Day 10**: Learn about **Conditional Rendering** in React.
- **Day 11**: **Lists and Keys** in React to render dynamic lists efficiently.
- **Day 12**: Dive deeper into **Forms** in React: controlled vs uncontrolled components.
- **Day 13**: Learn about **React Router** for navigation between pages in a single-page application (SPA).
- **Day 14**: **React Context API** for managing global state without passing props down manually.

### 🌳 Day 15-21: Advanced React Features
- **Day 15**: **useReducer** Hook for complex state management in functional components.
- **Day 16**: **React Memoization**: Learn about **React.memo** and **useMemo** to optimize performance.
- **Day 17**: Introduction to **React Hooks** for functional components and understanding their lifecycle.
- **Day 18**: **Custom Hooks**: Learn how to create your own custom hooks to reuse logic.
- **Day 19**: Work with **Error Boundaries** to catch JavaScript errors in React components.
- **Day 20**: **React Portals** to render children into a different DOM subtree.
- **Day 21**: **Higher-Order Components (HOC)**: Reusable logic by wrapping components.

### 🌐 Day 22-30: React Ecosystem
- **Day 22**: **State Management** with **Redux**: Understand the flow of state in Redux (actions, reducers, store).
- **Day 23**: Integrate **Redux** into a React app and create a store.
- **Day 24**: **Thunk Middleware** for handling asynchronous actions in Redux.
- **Day 25**: **React Testing**: Learn about testing React components using **Jest** and **React Testing Library**.
- **Day 26**: **React Performance Optimization**: Learn about techniques to optimize React apps (code-splitting, lazy loading).
- **Day 27**: Learn about **React DevTools** for debugging and optimizing React applications.
- **Day 28**: **Next.js**: Learn about server-side rendering and static site generation using Next.js.
- **Day 29**: **TypeScript with React**: Understand how to use TypeScript in React projects for type safety.
- **Day 30**: Build a **React Full Stack Application**: Create a full application that uses React on the frontend and integrates with a backend.
